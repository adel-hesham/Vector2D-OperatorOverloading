# Vector2D - Operator Overloading in C++

This project implements a 2D vector class in C++ with operator overloading. 
It supports arithmetic operations, comparison, input/output streaming, 
and element access using the subscript operator.

## Features:
✔ Overloaded `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators for vector arithmetic  
✔ Overloaded `==` operator for comparison  
✔ Overloaded `++` (prefix & postfix) operators  
✔ Overloaded `[]` operator for element access  
✔ Overloaded `<<` and `>>` for easy input/output  

## How to Run:
```sh
g++ vector.cpp -o vector
./vector
